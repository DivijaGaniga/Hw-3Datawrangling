**NOTE:** Notice above the `author` field. You really should change this to your name. Many of
you did that, but many did not on the previous assignment.

## Step 1 - Familiarize yourself with the data and the assignment

In this assignment you'll do some exploratory data analysis
with R on a dataset US census information based on the [American Community Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/). The version of
this data that we'll be using is from a Kaggle dataset. See
https://www.kaggle.com/muonneutrino/us-census-demographic-data/data and look
at the column metadata for the county level table to see what the various
columns mean.

As we did in class, you'll be creating an R Markdown document to
both prepare a dataset and do some analysis as well as to document the
steps you did (and answer some questions I'll throw at you).

You'll notice a few "Hacker Extra" tasks
thrown in. These are for those of you who want to go a little above and beyond
and attempt some more challenging tasks. 

## Step 2 - Create a new R Markdown document

Save this file as a new R Markdown document and name it **HW3_EDAwR_[_your last
name_].Rmd**. Mine would be called **HW3_EDAwR_isken.Rmd**. Save it into the
same folder as this file.

This will be your working directory. 

## Step 3 - Set working directory and explore data folder

Set the working directory or create an R Studio project in the current folder. You'll notice that there is a folder named **data**.
Inside of it you'll find the data files for this assignment:

- **acs2015_census_tract_data.csv**
- **acs2015_county_data.csv**
- **us_census_bureau_regions_and_divisions.csv**
- **county_MI.csv**

The first two files are from the Kaggle site for this dataset. The last file,
**county_MI.csv**, is a file that I created and just contains data from
Michigan. The R script, **census_data_prep.R** was used to create the file as
well as to merge information from the
**us_census_bureau_regions_and_divisions.csv** file with the county data.


## Step 4 - Complete the following R tasks and answer questions

Now you'll need to complete the following tasks in R. Just like we did in class,
you should use a combination of markdown text (be concise, no need to write tons
of text) to explain what you are doing and R code chunks to actually do it. 

**When you are done, use the "Knit" button to generate an HTML file from your R
Markdown.**

**You'll be submitting BOTH the completed R Markdown file as well as the
generated HTML file.**

You'll notice that I've left some empty code chunks as well
as some partially filled in code chunks. Of course, feel free to add more code
chunks as needed.

Let's load a few libraries we'll need:

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```


Let's read in the data.

```{r read_countydata}
county_df <- read.csv(file='data/county.csv')
county_MI <- read.csv(file='data/county_MI.csv')
```

The county_MI data frame contains data for Michigan only and includes an
peninsula field. See **census_data_prep.R** to see how this field was
created. It involves scraping a table out of a web page.


### Problem 1 - Basic filtering 

Use county_MI.

Using basic R commands (i.e. no plyr or dplyr) list all the rows for counties in the Lower Peninsula.

```{r rows}
(counties_LP <- head(county_MI[county_MI$peninsula == 'LP',], n=10))


```


Now do the same thing but use dplyr. Do NOT use the pipe operator.

```{r filter1}

head(filter(county_MI,peninsula == 'LP' ), n=10)

```

Repeat using dplyr and using the pipe operator.

```{r filter2}
county_MI %>% filter(peninsula == 'LP') %>% head(10)

```



List rows for counties in the UP with population less than or equal to 10000. Use dplyr.

```{r}

county_MI %>% filter(peninsula == 'UP') %>% filter(TotalPop <= 10000)

```

Find counties with population greater than or equal to 40000, more men than women and sorted in
ascending order by population. Use dplyr.

```{r}

county_MI %>% filter(TotalPop <= 40000) %>% filter (Men > Women) %>% arrange(TotalPop)

```



### Problem 2 - Selecting columns

Use county_MI. Use dplyr unless otherwise specified.

Counties in the upper peninsual with median income between 10000 and 35000. Sort
in ascending order by median income. Remember, the Income field is already
median income. Only select the County, TotalPop and Income fields.

```{r}
county_MI %>% filter(peninsula =='UP', Income >= 10000 & Income <= 35000) %>% 
              arrange(Income) %>% 
              select(County, TotalPop,Income)

```


Counties with population < 50000 and just the the first 5 columns (except for
column 3) along with Income and Poverty. Sort descending by Poverty.

Notice that dplyr has numerous helpful methods for column selection. Do NOT
manually list out all the necessary columns. Use the dplyr methods for
selecting groups of columns by column number, column name, the - to not include something, etc.

```{r}

county_MI %>% filter(TotalPop < 50000) %>% select((1:5),Income,Poverty, -(3))

```


Counties with population > 100000 and just the the first 2 columns, TotalPop, and any column starting with "Inc". Sort descending by Income.

```{r}

county_MI %>% filter(TotalPop >100000) %>%
              select(1:2, TotalPop,contains("Inc"))

```



### Problem 3 - Create new columns with mutate

Use county_MI.

Create a new column called pct_F which is the percentage of females in that
county. First do it by NOT saving the computed column. Just compute it
and display the columns County, TotalPop, pct_F. Sort descending by pct_F.


```{r mutate1}
county_MI %>% mutate(pct_F = (Women/TotalPop) *100) %>% 
              select(County,TotalPop,pct_F) %>% 
              arrange(pct_F) %>% head(10)

 
```

Now compute pct_F and save the pct_F column (along with the existing columns) in
a new data frame called county_MI_x.


```{r mutate2}

county_MI_x <- county_MI %>% mutate(pct_F = (Women/TotalPop) *100) %>% 
              arrange(pct_F)

```

Show that it worked by using select to show County, TotalPop, pct_F in
the new data frame.

```{r}
county_MI_x %>% select(County,TotalPop,pct_F) %>% 
                head(10)

```


County with highest percentage of women? Lowest percentage of women? Create dplyr
statements that make it easy to answer these questions. Several ways to do this.

```{r}

county_MI_x %>% arrange(desc(pct_F)) %>% head (1) %>% 
                rbind(county_MI_x %>% arrange(desc(county_MI_x$pct_F)) %>% tail(1))


```


Confirm that the columns Professional, Service, Office, Construction,  and 
Production sum up to 100 (within +- .105). There are a number of ways to do
this. You could use `mutate` and/or use base R commands. 

> However, do
> not simply do a summary() and rely on the values displayed. Depending on

> all rows meet the desired condition. That's not practical with 100000 rows.

```{r}

```


### Summarization

Use county_MI.

Find total population by peninsula using dplyr.


```{r pop_peninsula}


```

Number of counties by peninsula.

```{r numcounties_peninsula}


```


Compute the following statistics for TotalPop by peninsula. Do it with
one big dplyr statement.

* mean, median, 5% trimmed mean
* range, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, IQR
* 5th, 25th, 50th, 75th and 95th quantiles

```{r summarystats_mi}
# county_MI %>%
#   group_by() %>%
#   summarize(MinTotalPop = min(TotalPop),
#             MeanTotalPop = mean(TotalPop),
#             FINISH ME
```




Now look at the entire US. Which states have the highest average percentage of
construction workers? Just return the top 10 states and their pct construction
values.

```{r top10construction}

```


Which states have the lowest average percentage of people who drive to work?

```{r lowpctdrive1}

```

Which counties having a total population greater than 75000 have the lowest
percentage of people who drive to work? Display State, County and Drive.



```{r lowpctdrive2}

```

Repeat the previous query for the state of Michigan.

```{r lowpctdrive_mi}

```


For this next question you do **not** need plyr or dplyr.

Create a correlation matrix for total population, income and child poverty. 

Notice the `use = ` argument which allows you to deal with fact that you don't want
NAs in unrelated fields to end up causing R to throw out perfectly fine
rows for this correlation matrix.

```{r}

```

```{r correlation}
# cor(county_df[???], use = "???")
```

Write a few sentences interpreting the correlation matrix.

Compute the proportion of counties in the US with total population greater than 75000.
You can do this very easily without dplyr. Hint: mean(). 

```{r pctgt75k}

```

Use dplyr and ggplot along with the pipe operator %>% to create a histogram of SelfEmployed
for all counties in the US with total population > 50000. On the
y-axis show relative frequencies instead of counts.


```{r histo1}
# county_df %>%
#   ??? %>%
#   ???() + geom_histogram(???)
```


Create a bar chart showing total population by region. Use dplyr as needed to create
a data frame to plot. Hint: You'll also want to learn about the `stat` layer in ggplot.


```{r create_df_toplot}
# pop_by_region <- county_df %>%
#   ???
#   
```

```{r barchart}
# ggplot(data=pop_by_region) + ???
```


** Hacker Extras**

Now redo the previous plot but make it a horizontal bar plot and order the bars
from longest to shortest.

Google "ggplot bar reorder". First hit: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25664007/reorder-bars-in-geom-bar-ggplot2

```{r barchart2}


```

How do the three counties in the Metro Detroit area (Macomb, Oakland, Wayne) compare in terms
of the breakdown of what kinds of jobs people have. Create a stacked bar chart. Mine
looks like this:

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics('images/stacked_bars.png')
```

Hint: The tidyr package is helpful.


```{r gather}
# Transform from wide to long


```

```{r stackedplot}


```
